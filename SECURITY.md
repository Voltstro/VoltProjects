## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability within VoltProjects, please report directly to Voltstro via email or Discord, and please provide as much detail as you can.

You should except a reply within 48 hours. If you do not receive a reply within that time frame, or your report is rejected, feel free to publicly disclose the vulnerability however you see fit (such as via GH issues).

If the report is accepted, please give me 30 days to patch the vulnerability, and deploy it. Once the vulnerability is patched, it can then be publicly disclosed.
